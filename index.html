        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.
           The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. 
           Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. 
           Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. 
           Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
